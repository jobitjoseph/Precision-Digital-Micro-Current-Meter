Keeping track of extremely low current levels is often essential when developing or testing low-power devices, especially in the field of embedded systems and battery-operated electronics. This project presents a compact and reliable micro current meter that makes such measurements straightforward and accessible. It is built around an STM32 microcontroller and features an OLED display for real-time readouts. The analog front end is designed to detect small current flows accurately, converting them into voltage levels that the microcontroller can process with high resolution. Whether you're measuring sleep current in a sensor node or characterising a power-efficient circuit, the device offers a clear and immediate view of power consumption trends.
The meter is designed for ease of use on the workbench, with a focus on readability, stability, and portability. The OLED display provides a crisp output that remains visible under most lighting conditions, while the microcontroller handles signal processing and automatic range detection. Calibration routines ensure measurement consistency across various load conditions. With no need for external tools or complex setups, the device offers a plug-and-play experience for engineers, developers, or hobbyists working with ultra-low power electronics. Its practical design makes it a useful tool for anyone seeking to analyse power usage with precision and simplicity.
